# Proyek-Akhir-SSF-Kelompok-B11 (Air Quality Monitor)

A smart home air quality monitor using Arduino and assembly language that helps users monitor the air quality in their living spaces. The system will use DHT-11 to detect humidity and MQ2 gas sensor to measure various air quality parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air pollutants, especially smoke. It will display real-time air quality data on the Serial Monitor and provide alerts with a provided buzzer when the air quality exceeds predefined thresholds.

## Software 
Arduino IDE -> utilized to compile and upload the program onto the Arduino board through a USB type B cable.
Proteus -> utilized to simulate and verify the circuit design.
AVR Assembly -> The program is entirely coded in AVR Assembly language and has been developed and solely tested on the Arduino UNO R3 board with the ATMega328p processor.
## Hardware
### 1. Arduino UNO R3
 A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P that provides digital and analog I/O pins and can be programmed to control various electronic devices.
