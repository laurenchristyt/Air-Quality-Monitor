# Proyek-Akhir-SSF-Kelompok-B11 (Air Quality Monitor)

A smart home air quality monitor using Arduino and assembly language that helps users monitor the air quality in their living spaces. The system will use DHT-11 to detect humidity and MQ2 gas sensor to measure to measure various air quality parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air pollutants. It will display real-time air quality data on the Serial Monitor and provide alerts with a provided buzzer when the air quality exceeds predefined thresholds.
